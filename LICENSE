CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;

   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
       performer(s);

   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
        likeness depicted in a Work;

   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
      data in a Work;

   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
       the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on
       the legal protection of databases, and under any national
       implementation thereof, including any amended or successor
       version of such directive); and

   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout
        the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
        implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose, including
without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the
public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors,
fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation,
rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable
action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
contemplated by Affirmer's rights under applicable law.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express statement of the purposes of the Waiver. The
License Fallback provisions are conditional on Affirmer not making any
claim of infringement for the Work as provided in the Waiver. If any such
claim is judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
claim of invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate or render
ineffective the Waiver. Nothing shall be construed as requiring
acceptance of any terms or conditions other than those explicitly set
forth in this License. Only the terms of this License, and any terms
imposed by the licensor under sections 3 and 4 below, shall be binding on
other persons.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
      abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
      document.

   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
      title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
      or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
      all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
      persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
      without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
      Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining
      any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
      use thereof.

   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
      a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with
      respect to this CC0 use.

Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to
material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the
"Licensor." The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is
